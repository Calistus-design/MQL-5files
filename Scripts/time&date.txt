another thing to clarify the low price wont necessaryily be the low price of the red candle. as you know we can have green candle as the low price. i think we can have like 3 lines representing a color change level. where one is for the red cd closing, another is for the red cd low wick price, and another is for the green cd low wick price.


Strict Time Windows: The entire process—Zone Creation, Breakout, and Retest—must happen within a defined, compact window of time.
New Rule: When a blue zone is created, the indicator will now only look for a breakout within a fixed Breakout_Window (e.g., 25 candles) after the zone is formed.
If a breakout occurs in that window, it will then only look for a retest within a fixed Retest_Window (e.g., 15 candles) after the breakout.
Result: This forces the entire setup to be "immediate" and local, as you require. Zones far in the past will not be considered.
Clean Separation of Logic: The code will be restructured to be cleaner and follow our tested steps without error.
